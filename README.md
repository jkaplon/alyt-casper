===========

Customizations to the stock ghost.org casper theme.
This theme is used for the [At Least You're Trying podcast website](http://gtradio.net/alyt).
Head over there to see it in action.

Be warned, this is my first attempt at front-end theme development.
If you look closely you will find places where I've done silly things like adding CSS in-line with my HTML (is this bad practice or a potential win for page performance?...you be the judge).
I'm sure there are other rookie mistakes as well.
